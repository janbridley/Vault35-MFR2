# Vault35-MFR2

Please note that the screw holes in all of the files are sized at 1.8mm for M2 x 4mm screws on my 3D printer. You will need to modify the files to match how you intend to manufacture one of these cases 

The Vault .2 Bigger contains all of the same files but with the inside of the case cut .2mm more outward to help with the lack of dimensionality of some manufacturing methods.
